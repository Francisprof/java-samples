# Java Samples: Basic Problems and Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various basic Java programming problems. It serves as a record of my practice and learning journey in Java. Each problem focuses on fundamental concepts and common algorithms.

## About This Repository

This collection of Java code examples covers a range of basic problems often encountered in introductory programming courses or technical interviews. The problems are solved with an emphasis on clarity, efficiency, and good coding practices. I've tried to provide well-commented code to explain the logic and approach for each solution.

## Problems Included

Here's a list of the types of problems you'll find in this repository (you should replace these with the *actual* problems you solved):

*   **Warm-up Challenges:**
    *   `HelloWorld.java`: The classic "Hello, World!" program.
    *   `SumOfTwoNumbers.java`:  Adds two integers.
    *   `SwapTwoVariables.java`: Swaps the values of two variables without a temporary variable.
*   **Conditional Logic & Loops:**
    *   `EvenOrOdd.java`: Checks if a number is even or odd.
    *   `LargestOfThree.java`: Finds the largest of three numbers.
    *   `Factorial.java`: Calculates the factorial of a number.
    *   `FibonacciSeries.java`: Prints the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.
*   **String Manipulation:**
    *   `PalindromeChecker.java`: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
    *   `ReverseString.java`: Reverses a string.
    *   `CountVowels.java`: Counts the number of vowels in a string.
*   **Arrays:**
    *   `FindLargestElement.java`: Finds the largest element in an array.
    *   `LinearSearch.java`: Implements a linear search on an array.
    *   `CalculateAverage.java`: Calculates the average of array elements.

**(Remember to add or remove problems based on your actual solutions!)**

## How to Use

Each problem is contained in its own Java file (e.g., `ProblemName.java`). You can:

1.  **View the Code:** Browse the files directly on GitHub to read the code and the comments explaining the solutions.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine to run and experiment with the code:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/franciscse/java-samples.git](https://github.com/franciscse/java-samples.git)
    ```
3.  **Compile and Run:**  Use a Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run the individual files:
    ```bash
    javac ProblemName.java
    java ProblemName
    ```

## Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have a JDK installed on your system (JDK 8 or later is recommended).
*   **Basic Java Knowledge:** A fundamental understanding of Java syntax and programming concepts will be helpful to understand the solutions.

## Contributing

**Note:**

*   **Replace Placeholders:** Remember to replace the example problem names with your actual content.
*   **LICENSE File:** Consider adding a `LICENSE` file to your repository to explicitly state the terms under which others can use your code.
*   **Enhance:** You can expand this README by including details about testing, performance considerations, or further problem areas you plan to explore.
*   **Be Specific:** In the "Problems Included" section, briefly explain what each problem is about, not just the filename.
*   **Check for Broken Links:** Once you save the README, make sure the links to your GitHub profile and the LICENSE file are working correctly.

This updated README now includes your GitHub profile and the repository link. Good luck with your Java learning journey!
